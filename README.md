# `kubenet`

This repository contains a guide that
describes how to set up a production-like Kubernetes cluster on a laptop.

It is written in the spirit, and with the inspiration from
[Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way), and can be treated as its
lengthier, extended version, optimized for a local deployment.

This repository contains the guide itself, as well as some auxiliary scripts and
configuration files, referred throughout the guide's text.

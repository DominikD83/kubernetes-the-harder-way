# Kubernetes the Harder Way

A guide to setting up a production-like Kubernetes cluster on a local machine 
(optimized for macOS and Apple Silicon).

[**THE GUIDE**](docs/00_Introduction.md)

It is written in the spirit, and with inspirations from Kelsey Hightower's [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way), 
and can be treated as its lengthier, extended version, optimized for a local deployment.

This repository contains the guide itself, as well as some auxiliary scripts and
configuration files, referred throughout the guide's text.
